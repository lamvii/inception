### what is the diffrence betweeen using docker image with docker-compose and without docker compose
The main difference between using a Docker image with Docker Compose and without Docker Compose is that Docker Compose allows you to manage and coordinate multiple Docker containers that are used together to run an application. Without Docker Compose, you would need to run each Docker container separately and manually configure the network and other settings that are needed for the containers to communicate and work together. Docker Compose simplifies this process by allowing you to define the containers and their configuration in a single file, and then run and manage all of the containers together using a single command. This makes it easier to deploy and manage complex applications that are composed of multiple Docker containers.

### the benefits of docker compared to VMs

Docker and virtual machines (VMs) are both technologies that are used to run applications in isolated environments. However, there are some key differences between the two that make Docker a more attractive option in some situations. Some of the main benefits of using Docker compared to VMs include:

- Docker is lightweight and more efficient than VMs because it uses shared operating system resources, whereas VMs require a full copy of the operating system for each instance.
- Docker containers are portable and can run on any host machine that has the Docker runtime installed, whereas VMs are tied to the host hardware and require a separate instance for each platform.
- Docker provides better scalability and resource utilization than VMs because it allows you to run multiple containers on the same host and easily distribute them across multiple hosts in a cluster.
- Docker makes it easier to manage and deploy applications because it allows you to define the entire application stack, including the operating system, libraries, dependencies, and runtime, in a single package called a Docker image.


These are just some of the benefits of using Docker compared to VMs. In general, Docker provides a more efficient, portable, and scalable way to run applications in isolated environments, and it is well-suited for a wide range of applications and deployment scenarios.


### what is docker-network

Docker is a tool that is used to create and manage containers, which are lightweight, standalone, and executable packages of software that include everything needed to run the application, including the code, libraries, dependencies, and runtime. A Docker network is a virtual network that is used to connect Docker containers. It allows containers to communicate with each other and access the network resources they need in order to function properly. Docker networks are a key part of the Docker ecosystem and provide an important layer of abstraction and isolation for containers.

#### Network driver summary:

User-defined bridge:
 networks are best when you need multiple containers to communicate on the same Docker host.
- Host networks:
 are best when the network stack should not be isolated from the Docker host, but you want other aspects of the container to be isolated.
- Overlay networks:
 are best when you need containers running on different Docker hosts to communicate, or when multiple applications work together using swarm services.
- Macvlan networks:
 are best when you are migrating from a VM setup or need your containers to look like physical hosts on your network, each with a unique MAC address.
- Third-party network:
 plugins allow you to integrate Docker with specialized network stacks.

### What is TLS:
TLS (Transport Layer Security) is a cryptographic protocol that is used to secure communication over a computer network. It is designed to provide secure, end-to-end communication by encrypting data sent between devices, such as computers, smartphones, and tablets. This helps to prevent third parties from intercepting and reading the data as it is transmitted over the network. TLS is often used in conjunction with other protocols, such as HTTPS, to provide secure, encrypted communication for applications such as web browsing, email, and instant messaging.

	``` TLS 1.3 is the latest version of the TLS (Transport Layer Security) cryptographic protocol. It is designed to provide improved security and performance compared to previous versions of TLS. Some of the key features of TLS 1.3 include improved encryption, faster handshake times, and support for new cipher suites. TLS 1.3 is designed to be more resistant to attacks, such as man-in-the-middle attacks, and to provide better privacy for users by removing certain features that were present in earlier versions of TLS. It is currently supported by many popular web browsers and other applications. ```
